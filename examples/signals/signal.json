	"description" : "One of the most powerful features of Tone.js and the Web Audio API is the ability to  perform math and logic on audio-rate signal. Signals can be ramped and scheduled to control Audio Parameters and  other Signals making it simple to create elaborate,  interconnected automations. This example applies a series of mappings to a signal value and applies the results of those mappings to the frequency attribute of 2 Tone.Oscillators and a Tone.LFO",
